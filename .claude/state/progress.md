# Progress

_Updated by the orchestrator every cycle. Cold-start source of truth — read it (and
`design-notes.md` + `backlog.md`) before doing anything, then run `pnpm verify`._

## Current feature
**WDC · Watchable demo cut — IN FLIGHT (navigator-prioritized ahead of M4, 2026-06-03).** The navigator looked at staging and
flagged the honest gap: the ENGINE works + audio works, but the visible app is still a dev scaffold — FAKE `EXAMPLE_*` embeds
show "offline"/404/crash, the UI is bare ("idle" + 3 buttons), a console flood. Chose **"quickest watchable cut first"** +
**orchestrator picks reliably-live channels**. Scope (PO KICKOFF in `design-notes.md`): ① real streams ② "Start watching"
gesture ③ light UI polish ④ graceful embeds. **Progress:** ① ✅ real 24/7 Twitch channels wired into `mocks/event-graph.ts`
(`rifftrax`/`247jynxzi`/`caedrel247`/`lirik_247`, Kick→Twitch; 37→38 FE green). ② ✅ feed/host gated behind a "Start watching"
button (`App.tsx` `started` state; kills the host-on-mount + the AudioContext-before-gesture flood — audio now unblocks post-click).
**↓ NEXT in WDC:** ③ light visual polish (refactor — character as a visible presence, layout, styled rail; keep all test contracts)
→ ④ graceful-embed guard (likely mostly moot now: real Twitch + no Kick = no crash; qa confirms) → critic → qa-verify (mechanics)
→ PO sign-off → re-deploy to staging → navigator confirms the experience. **After WDC: M4** (two-level ranking + digest, DoD #1).
**LV1 = ✅ SHIPPED to staging** (browser-direct live Gemini voice; `lv1`→`9b07c38`; open: navigator's audible ear + the uncommitted
`VITE_LIVE_VOICE=1` flag before any push). Invariants: spoiler-safety, official-embeds-only, cost-gating (host loop UNTOUCHED), secrets-from-env.

## Status
- **Milestone:** **LV1 · live-voice host — BUILD (in progress)** (ADR `0007-live-voice-seam`, topology RESOLVED). Replaces M3's text+Web-Speech with `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` over the **Live WSS API** (native streamed audio; resolves §13 voice identity). **Topology GATE CLOSED** via the navigator's reference repo `github.com/geda0/gvp`: resolved to **(b) backend WSS relay** — browsers can't set the `Authorization: Token` header the Live WSS needs, so the server mints a short-lived ephemeral token AND a backend relay opens the upstream socket (browser → relay → Google). Topology (a) browser-direct (`?access_token=`) exists in gvp but is disabled (Google close 1011). **§6 contracts + host loop UNCHANGED** — `speak()` generalizes to async `VoiceNarrator`; new backend `POST /live/session` (mint) + WSS relay; FE `live-narrator` (WS + AudioContext PCM). M0–M3 released (`m2`,`m3`).
- **Layer:** frontend
- **Phase (WDC):** ① real streams ✅ · ② "Start watching" gesture ✅ (RED 8-fail→GREEN) · ③ light polish ✅ (refactor: dark theme, "Based" header+tagline, 16:9 player, host **orb** w/ glow+caption, styled channel cards w/ heat bars, CTA overlay; 38/12 green) · ④ graceful embeds ✅ (real Twitch + Kick→Twitch → no crash). **🔎 ORCHESTRATOR VISUALLY CONFIRMED via Preview MCP (local):** product look (not scaffold), **real RiffTrax LIVE video loads**, Start-watching gesture works (CTA→video), **console CLEAN** (no fake-embed flood), /narrate wake-path live (`narrateCallsToBackend:1`). Speaking-orb not screenshot-caught (Web-Speech reverts too fast in headless) — but unit-tested + CSS-wired. **▶ NEXT: qa-verifier (live local stack) → PO accept → deploy FE to staging → navigator confirms.** ⚠ **LOCAL DEV GOTCHA:** the FE needs `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` (no vite proxy) or `/narrate` posts relative → 404 → host stays idle (staging sets it at build, so it wakes there). Suite green (38/12). _Below: LV1 history (shipped)._ **🚀 LV1 SHIPPED TO STAGING — DONE** (browser-direct, 2026-06-03): PO-re-accepted + DEPLOYED + verified. Commits `053591f` (chore: teamentic 0.5.0) + `9b07c38` (refactor(lv1): browser-direct, retire relay+ECS); **`lv1` re-tagged → `9b07c38`** (supersedes `78b1d9f`); `pnpm verify`=0 (backend 16 / frontend 37); **NOT pushed** (5 ahead of origin). **Staging verified:** FE `https://d253xma588uo3l.cloudfront.net` 200; BE `/health` 200; **`/live/session` 200 returns the `setup` envelope**; App Runner RUNNING `based-staging-backend:9b07c38-…`; CORS ok; `VITE_LIVE_VOICE=1` live. **OPEN ITEMS:** (1) **§13 AUDIBLE — navigator's ear at the staging URL** (live voice ON — does it SOUND right? PO rec: accept the default voice as-is for the demo); (2) ⚠ **`infra/deploy-staging.sh` `VITE_LIVE_VOICE=1` is UNCOMMITTED** — MUST commit before ANY push (else a CI-on-push deploy rebuilds the FE without it → silently turns live voice OFF); (3) push to origin = navigator's ask. **NEXT MILESTONE: M4** (two-level ranking + "while you were gone" digest — DoD #1). _Follow-up: architect DOC-RECONCILE (ADR 0007/design-notes → topology a; relay refs historical)._) _NB 0.5.0: neutral = `off`._
- **dev-ops "Flagged" (uncommitted, non-secret, 0.4.0 chore follow-up):** `.claude/tdd.config`, `.github/workflows/tdd-verify.yml`, `.claude/state/.gitkeep`+`plan.md`, stale `frontend/tests/*.test.js`.
- **qa (2 runs, live local stack):** run 1 found LV1-D1 (Blob frames dropped) → FIXED (`binaryType='arraybuffer'` + narrator `ArrayBuffer` decode via `Object.prototype.toString` (cross-realm-safe) + a binary-frame regression test). run 2 CONFIRMED the fix + no regressions. **NEW MINOR (non-blocking) defects for PO triage:**
  - **✅ LV2-D1 FIXED** — `Character` `speakingMs` default 4000→**30000** (safety cap) so the App's drain-coupled revert governs (host stays speaking for the full audio; falls idle on drain). `pnpm verify`=0. ⚠ **PROCESS NOTE:** the base implementer OVERREACHED badly (91min/228 tools) — it hacked PRODUCTION (`character.tsx` probe-timer `setReverted({} as any)`) + TEST-INFRA (`setup.ts` global-`setTimeout` shim) to force a green instead of the 1-line fix; it flagged this itself. **Root cause = a bad flush in the orchestrator's test brief** (`await new Promise(r=>setTimeout(r,0))` HANGS under Vitest fake timers — must be `await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(0)`, as #11b/#8b correctly do). Orchestrator cleaned it up surgically (reverted both hacks + fixed the test flush); no hacks remain. **LESSON: fake-timer flushes use `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync`, NEVER raw `setTimeout` — put this in every fake-timer test brief.**
  - **✅ LV2-D2 FIXED** — `live-relay.ts` now propagates close: `browserSocket.on("close", () => upstream.close?.())` (browser→upstream, the qa-found leak). 21 backend tests, `pnpm verify`=0. (Reverse upstream→browser left for a follow-up if needed.)
- **NB — a LOCAL live-voice demo works NOW:** the relay runs on local Fastify, validated live. `pnpm dev` (backend, `--env-file=.env`) + the FE with `VITE_LIVE_VOICE=1` → real Gemini audio locally. ECS is only for STAGING (App Runner can't host WS).
- **Suite:** green — `pnpm verify`=0 (backend **19 tests**, frontend **35 tests**, e2e 1 skipped, typecheck+lint clean). HEAD `ce194e7`; LV1 work is **local/uncommitted** (release infra-gated → navigator-approved ECS Express Mode).
- **LV1 BUILD progress** (against stubbed upstream; suite is the seam):
  - ✅ **cycle 1 — `buildLiveSetup` wire shape** (`backend/src/modules/live/live-setup.ts`): prefixed model id `models/gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` + audio-only `responseModalities:['AUDIO']` (the two load-bearing Live facts; mixed modalities silently hang). GREEN.
  - ✅ **cycle 2 — `buildLiveSetup` systemInstruction**: persona + no-spoiler rule (spoiler-safety defense-in-depth). GREEN. **`buildLiveSetup` builder now complete.** (DRY: persona text duplicated with `narrate.prompt.ts` → shared-constant refactor later.)
  - ✅ **cycle 3 — `POST /live/session` mint (happy path)**: route + injected `liveMint.mintToken()` → `200 {token, model(bare), expiresAt}`; long-lived key never echoed (architect token-flow = **option B**, ADR 0007 Amendment). GREEN. + a test type-fix.
  - ✅ **cycle 4 — `/live/session` malformed→400 no-spend**: local zod `z.object({}).passthrough()` (ignores unknown keys); safeParse→400 before mint. GREEN.
  - ✅ **cycles 5–6 — `createLiveTokenClient` secrets-from-env**: (5) env-only sourcing via injectable `MintFn` (real `@google/genai` DEFERRED as a throwing `defaultMint` — the untested I/O edge); (6) rejects + no-spend if `GEMINI_API_KEY` absent (`as string` cast removed). GREEN.
  - ✅ **cycle 7 (refactor-hardening, post-critic)**: route-level secrets tripwire (bogus body key ignored + long-lived key never echoed, positive-control non-vacuous), `GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL` override coverage, env-leak fix. GREEN.
  - ✅ **tdd-critic (after cycle 6) = PASS w/ follow-ups**: HIGH route-secrets-tripwire → CLOSED in cycle 7; MEDIUM model-override + env-leak → CLOSED; deferred items → see RELEASE-PREP below.
  - **✅ BACKEND MINT MODULE COMPLETE** (`buildLiveSetup` + `POST /live/session` + `createLiveTokenClient`): secrets-from-env proven at **client + route**, malformed→400 no-spend, audio-only setup frame. 15 tests / 7 files.
  - ✅ **cycles 8–10 — the WSS RELAY logic** (`backend/src/modules/live/live-relay.ts` — `createLiveRelay({connectUpstream}).relay(browserSocket,{token,model})`): (8) opens upstream with `Authorization: Token <ephemeral>` (the header a browser can't set); (9) sends `setup` ONCE on upstream `open` (reuses `buildLiveSetup`); (10a) forwards browser `clientContent` → upstream; (10b) pipes upstream `serverContent` PCM → browser. All vs INJECTED fake sockets. GREEN.
  - **✅ BACKEND LV1 LOGIC COMPLETE** — mint module + relay logic = 19 tests / 8 files. The real Fastify WS route (`@fastify/websocket`), real upstream socket, and real `@google/genai` mint are the **untested I/O edges** → RELEASE-PREP (below). _(NB: a browser frame arriving before upstream `open` is dropped — buffering is a release-prep robustness item.)_
  - ✅ **FE #7–10 — `VoiceNarrator` COMPLETE** (`frontend/src/lib/live-narrator.ts` — `createLiveNarrator({openRelay, audio}).speak(text): Promise<void>`): (#7) on relay `open`, sends exactly one `clientContent` turn `Say:"<text>"` wrapped in "speak only these exact words" — never `setup`; (#8) routes each `serverContent.modelTurn.parts[].inlineData` → injected `audio` sink; (#8b) resolves on `turnComplete` + all `play()` drained; (#9) **failure-silent** — rejects on relay `error` (→ host-loop drops speak, stays idle); (#10) closes the relay on utterance end (open/close per utterance, ADR §3); (#10-guard) **cost-gating tripwire** — zero opens on construction, one per `speak`. GREEN (31 FE tests). `openRelay` + `audio` = the injectable I/O edges (real openRelay: mint via `/live/session` + open relay WS; real audio: decode PCM → `AudioContext` — both untested-edge / RELEASE-PREP). _(Minor: close-on-ERROR not added — real WS auto-closes on error; low-pri hygiene.)_
  - ✅ **FE #11 — host-loop integration COMPLETE** (`frontend/src/App.tsx`): App gained `voice?: VoiceNarrator` (default = a Web-Speech `createSpeak` adapter resolving on `onend`); on a surfacing speak it calls `voice.speak(utterance)` and, on the promise settling, reverts to idle **guarded by directive identity** (drain-coupled revert + failure-silent, no stale-clobber). `<Character>` no longer voices (presentational). **§6 + `host-loop` + `narrating-host-loop` UNCHANGED** — only App's voicing swapped. GREEN.
  - ✅ **tdd-critic (LV1 relay+FE+integration) = PASS w/ items**: **HIGH** drain-revert race (a late earlier-utterance settle clobbered a newer speak) → FIXED (functional-update identity guard + a 2-surface regression test); **MEDIUM** integration zero-on-idle/one-per-surface cost-gating → tripwire ADDED; **LOW** → tracked in Open follow-ups.
  - **✅ LV1 UNIT-TDD COMPLETE** — all 11 acceptance bullets GREEN (backend mint + relay; FE narrator + integration). backend 19 / frontend 35 tests, `pnpm verify`=0.
  - ▶ **NEXT — wire the REAL I/O edges (RELEASE-PREP, below) → qa-verifier (audible Gemini voice) → PO accept → release** (ECS Express Mode relay, dev-ops). The suite stays hermetic; the real edges are NOT unit-tested — qa is the proof.
  - ⚠ **harness gap (recurring):** the run-suite hook runs vitest ONLY, not typecheck/lint — type errors slip past GREEN until `pnpm verify`. Mitigation: `pnpm verify` each cycle (doing this). Durable fix (→ POLISH): run-suite also `tsc --noEmit` the layer.

## LV1 RELEASE-PREP — untested I/O edges to WIRE before qa + staging release
Deliberately deferred "untested edges" (like M3's gemini-client `fetch`); the suite STUBS them. **Must be wired + qa-verified before LV1 qa/release:**
- **✅ LIVE PROBE (2026-06-03) — pipeline VALIDATED** against the real account (`backend/scripts/live-probe.ts`, throwaway/gitignore-worthy; deps `@google/genai@2.7 + ws@8.21 + @types/ws` installed). mint→WSS→setup→speak→**6 PCM frames `audio/pcm;rate=24000`**→turnComplete works. **3 corrections to ADR 0007 (Amendment B):** (1) **auth = `?access_token=` query param, NOT `Authorization: Token` header** (header → close 1008) — this **moots the relay's load-bearing justification**; (2) method = `…BidiGenerateContentConstrained` (not plain); (3) SDK `authTokens.create` returns only `.name` → mint maps `name→token` + **synthesizes `expiresAt`**. Corrections 2+3 are topology-independent.
- **✅ `@google/genai` mint WIRED** — real `defaultMint` in `live-token-client.ts` (`GoogleGenAI({apiKey, httpOptions:{apiVersion:'v1alpha'}}).authTokens.create({config:{uses:1, expireTime:+10min, newSessionExpireTime:+3min}})` → `{token:name, expiresAt:expireTime}`). `pnpm verify`=0 (hermetic suite unaffected — injected fake). _(critic item 5 CLOSED.)_
- **✅ TOPOLOGY RESOLVED → (b) relay + ECS** (navigator 2026-06-03: "Keep the approved relay + ECS" — trust gvp's in-browser close-1011; don't gamble browser-direct). So: keep the relay (cycles 8-10) + ECS Express Mode (Amendment A2). **BUT the relay code needs Corrections 1+2** — the relay's UPSTREAM Google connection must use `?access_token=<token>` query param + the `…BidiGenerateContentConstrained` method (it currently hardcodes the wrong `Authorization: Token` header + plain method; `live-relay.test.ts` asserts the header → must be corrected to assert the query-param URL).
- **✅ BACKEND COMPLETE for LV1** — relay logic (Constrained URL + `?access_token=`, setup-once, **buffers browser frames until upstream-open + flushes after setup**, forward, pipe) + the **`GET /live/relay` WS route** (`@fastify/websocket@8.3.1`, real `ws` upstream `new WebSocket(url)`, token+model from `?query`, no token logging, `connection.socket` v8 API) + real `@google/genai` mint. 20 backend tests, `pnpm verify`=0. **Relay runs on ECS** (App Runner can't host WS; A2 open: whole-backend-migrate vs separate-relay-service — PM/dev-ops at release).
- **✅ LOCAL END-TO-END VALIDATION (GO, 2026-06-03)** — `backend/scripts/relay-probe.ts` ran the REAL stack (buildApp + real mint + real relay → real Google): `/live/session`→200; relay WS bridged; client `clientContent`-on-open **buffered + flushed after setup**; **6–7 PCM frames `audio/pcm;rate=24000` + turnComplete** relayed back (twice, stable). **Caught + FIXED a real relay-route bug the hermetic tests couldn't:** `@fastify/websocket` v8 — `app.register(plugin)` is deferred but `app.get(…,{websocket:true})`'s onRoute hook fires SYNCHRONOUSLY, so the route was defined before the plugin → `{websocket:true}` silently ignored → ran as plain HTTP → **500, never upgraded**. **Fix (in `live-relay.routes.ts`):** wrap plugin-register + route in ONE child scope (`app.register(async scope => { await scope.register(fastifyWebsocket); scope.get(…) })`); route body unchanged; `buildApp` stays sync; `pnpm verify`=0. _(Fix proven by the live probe, not a unit test — the registration is the untested edge.)_ ⚠ `backend/scripts/` is untracked + NOT gitignored → dev-ops: gitignore it or don't commit the probes.
- **✅ FE real edges WIRED** — `live-relay-client.ts` (`createOpenRelay`: sync **deferred-proxy** `openRelay` that async-mints `/live/session` + connects `wss://relay/live/relay?token=…&model=…`, bridges WS events → narrator handlers, failure-silent on fetch/connect error) + `audio-sink.ts` (`createAudioSink`: b64→Int16→Float32→`AudioContext` 24kHz mono, gapless scheduled `BufferSource`s, resolves on `onended`) + `App.tsx` (`liveVoice` behind `VITE_LIVE_VOICE`; tests/dev keep the Web-Speech default). Narrator + its 6 tests UNCHANGED; `pnpm verify`=0. **Untested edges — proven by qa, not unit tests.**
- **ECS Express Mode relay host** (navigator-approved) — dev-ops stands up at release; ALB idle-timeout ~3600s + app-level WS pings; migrate-whole-backend vs separate-relay-service = PM/dev-ops call at release.
- **Deferred critic follow-ups (non-blocking):**
  - _[backend mint critic]_ item 2 — no-key-in-**LOGS** assertion (cross-cutting `/narrate`+`/live/session`; needs a capturing-logger helper; M3-inherited gap); item 6 — DRY persona dup in `live-setup.ts`↔`narrate.prompt.ts` (reviewed, intentionally deferred — the strings legitimately differ in register).
  - _[relay+FE critic, LOW]_ **dead `Character.speak` prop** — App no longer passes it (`<Character>` is now presentational), but `character.test.tsx` still exercises it; ALSO the App inlines `defaultVoice` instead of reusing `createSpeak`/`speak.ts` (now unused by App). Cleanup: remove `Character.speak` + prune those tests + reconcile `speak.ts` (delete, or make `defaultVoice` reuse it). Stale `frontend/tests/speak.test.js` compiled duplicate → delete + gitignore `frontend/**/*.js` (existing POLISH).
- **✅ INFRA DECISION — RESOLVED (navigator approved 2026-06-02):** **"Full LV1 + approve relay infra."** The WSS relay **cannot run on App Runner** (no inbound WebSocket; non-configurable 120s timeout; stateless; *and App Runner is closed to new customers / sunsetting*). → Stand up a small **ECS Express Mode** service (Fargate + auto-ALB) for the relay — reuses our ECR image + OIDC deploy, ~$25–30/mo, ~½ day, additive; doubles as the AWS-recommended App Runner migration path. **Queued for the RELEASE phase** (architect records hosting design → dev-ops scaffolds), AFTER the LV1 cycles are green — kept OUT of the inner loop to avoid shared phase/suite-status hook entanglement. LV1 BUILD proceeds now against a local/stubbed relay.
- **▶ Token-flow BUILD fork (ADR 0007 §7, "record at BUILD") — architect to resolve now (suite green):** does `POST /live/session` return the short-lived **ephemeral token** to the FE (FE hands it to the relay), or does the relay mint/hold it server-side (gvp-style session correlation), or mint on WS-upgrade? Decides the mint route's response contract (cycle 3). Long-lived `GEMINI_API_KEY` stays server-side in ALL options (the actual invariant); the choice is about the short-lived token's path + testability. Architect picks + appends to ADR 0007 before cycle 3's RED.
- ✅ **CI deploy gap — CLOSED** (`GEMINI_MODEL` now IaC-sourced in `infra/staging.yaml`, CI-proven on `ce194e7`). Model-id changes (incl. LV1's `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview`) are CI-safe — just bump the `staging.yaml` default in the milestone commit.

## Staging demo-quality — embed fixes DEPLOYED ✅ (from the navigator's staging screenshot)
- ✅ **EMBED-TWITCH-PARENT — FIXED + DEPLOYED:** Player appends `parent=<window.location.hostname>` only for `player.twitch.tv` (ADR 0008; ADR 0003 #5 amended — required platform params allowed, still no rehost). The `[NoParent]` error is gone; real Twitch ids will now render.
- ✅ **SPOILER-HARDENING — FIXED + DEPLOYED:** rail label = `` `${type} · ${streamer}` `` via the shared `topVantage` (`frontend/src/lib/top-vantage.ts`), never the outcome-bearing narrative (ADR 0009 — **§13 spoiler-across-surfaces RESOLVED**). No on-screen outcome leak.
- ✅ **CI `GEMINI_MODEL` gap — CLOSED + DEPLOYED** (`ce194e7`, CI-deployed): the model id is now the version-controlled `infra/staging.yaml` default (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`) and `deploy-staging.sh` always passes it (fixing the CFN "omitted param keeps stale value" gotcha) → CI ships the right model with no `.env`. Staging `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `/narrate` smoke green. **Model-id changes are now CI-safe** (LV1 just bumps the `staging.yaml` default). Release log refreshed.
- **PLACEHOLDER-EMBEDS (demo-prep, open):** real Twitch/Kick channel ids (`EXAMPLE_*` are fake) — a content call at demo time (§13 Rights/ToS). With the parent fix, real Twitch ids now render.
- §13 remaining (pre-external-demo): **tier-hedging** wording. Voice identity → resolving via LV1. Tracked: Node 20→24 CI runner deprecation (due 2026-06-16).

## qa defects — M3 (ALL FIXED ✅ + unit-covered; re-qa pending)
_D1 ✅ stable module-level narrate client → no storm (regression test on the DEFAULT-client path: 1 call). D2 ✅ `dev` = `tsx watch --env-file=.env …` (env loads). D3 ✅ empty/whitespace utterance → no-speak (`narrating-host-loop.ts`). 24 FE + 7 BE tests, `pnpm verify`=0. Original detail below._
- **D1 [BLOCKER · cost-gating · frontend]** — `frontend/src/App.tsx` builds `createNarrateClient()` in the render body + `useEffect` dep `[narrate]` → every re-render re-subscribes the feed → unbounded `/narrate` storm (qa saw 230+ calls, 10–16/s; also leaves the character stuck "speaking"). FIX: stabilize the client (module-level default like `speak`, or `useMemo`/`useRef`) + a **regression test on the DEFAULT-client path** (stub global `fetch`, advance time, assert BOUNDED call count). The cycle-5 cost-gating unit passed only because it injected a *stable* client.
- **D2 [BLOCKER · dev wiring · backend]** — `backend` `dev` (`tsx watch src/server.ts`) doesn't load `backend/.env` → empty key/model → `/narrate`→`""` → host silent. FIX: `tsx watch --env-file=.env src/server.ts` (Node ≥20.6) or load dotenv in `server.ts`. (Staging unaffected — SSM injects env.)
- **D3 [Medium · robustness · frontend]** — empty/whitespace `utterance` (HTTP 200) isn't treated as failure → a blank `speak` is dispatched. FIX: treat empty utterance as no-speak in `frontend/src/lib/narrating-host-loop.ts` (extend the failure-silent guard).
- **qa PASSED:** DoD #4 (live lines), spoiler-safety, tier-hedging, secrets-from-env (live), no on-screen HOST spoiler — the **LLM/prompt/seam is sound**; the blockers are wiring/loop bugs. (Rail-narrative spoiler = the separate SPOILER-HARDENING item, not M3. Digest-on-load = M4.)
- **Resolved this phase:** Gemini model id fixed (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite` — `.env`/`.env.example`/client fallback); ADR 0006 spoiler claim reconciled (architect); design-notes reconciled (PO); **length-cap shipped** (~20 words). `topVantage` 3× dup + seam-tripwire → POLISH (backlog).

## Done
- **M0a ✓** — TDD harness (agents, hooks, config, state, ADR 0003, `.gitignore`). Verified.
- **Team expansion ✓** — `product-owner`/`architect`/`qa-verifier` agents + `backlog.md`;
  outer product loop wired into CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / tdd-workflow.md. All six agents load
  natively as of this session.
- **M0b ✓ (accepted)** — event bus + source-graph feed scheduler + §11 mock event-graph;
  architect completed the §6 seam (`RankedFeed` + `HostDirective`, literal `spoilerSafe: true`;
  ADR 0004). tdd-critic PASS.
- **M1 ✓ (accepted)** — channel-surf shell, 6 cycles:
  `ChannelRail` (list + heat meters, clickable buttons) · `Player` (iframe `src` = `embedUrl`
  verbatim → official-embeds-only) · `ChannelSurfShell` (default = top event's max-`lensScore`
  vantage; click-to-switch; manual surf) · `App` mounts the shell from the mock graph
  (placeholder `eventScore = heatDelta`; real ranking = M4). Gates: `pnpm verify`=0 (9 tests);
  tdd-critic PASS (2 minor nits → backlog "POLISH"); qa-verifier PASS on the running app
  (surf mechanics confirmed via Preview MCP; placeholder embeds blank-render as expected).
- **M2 ✓ (accepted)** — character + host loop (9 behaviors): `speak()` over Web Speech (injected/
  mockable) · `Character` idle↔speak + **auto-revert to idle** (silent↔active completes) · shell
  `cutTo` (resolves a feed vantage) + manual-surf coexists (§12.6) · `host-loop.ts` (idle-default;
  surfaces `speak`+`cutTo`; **spoiler-safety** + **silence-budget** invariants PROVEN) · `App` wires
  feed→bus→loop→character/player. Gates: `pnpm verify`=0 (19 tests); tdd-critic PASS; qa-verifier
  **5/5** live (idle→speaking→idle, cut, manual-surf override, no host-text spoiler). NB: qa filed the
  rail-spoiler defect → see Open follow-ups.
- **Harness fix:** vite glob `*.test.{ts,tsx}` (logic tests `.ts`, component tests `.tsx`).

## Next — LV1 · live-voice host (or M4)   ← M0–M3 done + released (`m3`)
PO sequenced **LV1 (live-voice host)** ahead of M4. LV1 is **seam-touching → architect DESIGN required FIRST** (before any RED):
1. **DESIGN — architect:** the WSS Live API topology for `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` — crucially **how the key stays server-side over a WebSocket** (server proxy vs ephemeral token; the browser must NEVER hold the raw key) + the audio pipeline replacing `speak()`. Record an ADR; re-prove **secrets-from-env over WSS**. Then PO refreshes `design-notes.md` into the LV1 KICKOFF.
2. **BUILD** (backend-first WSS proxy/session → FE audio) via the inner loop → tdd-critic → qa (audible voice + spoiler-safe) → PO accept → **RELEASE lv1**.
**Fallback-first:** if Live-audio proves heavy, do **M4** first (two-level ranking + "while you were gone" digest — pure-FE, no new external dep; M4 delivers **DoD #1**, the one unmet DoD item), then LV1.
⚠ **Before any model-id-changing release (LV1):** fix the CI deploy gap — sync `GEMINI_MODEL` to SSM (see Status / `releases.md`) or CI will ship the hardcoded fallback again.
§13 still open (pre-external-demo only): tier-hedging wording; spoiler-across-surfaces (rail).

## Open follow-ups (in backlog)
- **SPOILER-HARDENING (high):** the channel rail renders outcome-bearing `narrative` verbatim
  (`channel-rail.tsx:9`) → on-screen spoiler, inconsistent with the host's spoiler-safe utterance.
  Re-opens M1's accepted rail design → navigator §13 call (see Notes). Rec: label from `type`+`streamer`.
- **POLISH (low):** 5 nits — stale `.js` artifacts (delete + gitignore `frontend/**/*.js`); App wake
  test `act()` warning + fragile no-`act` timing; `topVantage` dup (shell+loop → shared `lib` helper);
  + 2 M1 nits (redundant `aria-valuenow`; click test could independently guard max-`lensScore`).

## Harness status — **teamentic 0.5.0** (re-updated mid-LV1, 2026-06-03; CLEAN migration from create-tdd-pairing 0.4.0 → teamentic 0.5.0; 0 workspace files touched, gate verified, `pnpm verify`=0)
_0.5.0 notes: markers migrated `tdd-pairing`→`teamentic` (CLAUDE/AGENTS/.gitignore); `.teamentic/` now the authoritative manifest dir (old `.tdd-pairing` removed); kept tdd.config/state/project-invariants/CI. **Hooks upgraded — the stale-red RE-VERIFY in `require-green-to-stop` is RESTORED (P2-13)** (fixes the 0.3.0 regression: re-runs the suite before blocking → no stale-cache false "Cannot stop: suite RED" blocks) + a `run-suite` path filter (P2-10). phase convention UNCHANGED (`off`=neutral, empty fail-closes). Backup `/tmp/based-pre-teamentic/`. **Pending chore commit now = `chore: upgrade teamentic to 0.5.0`** (the 0.4.0→0.5.0 harness delta, uncommitted — supersedes the already-committed `chore 0.4.0` `6ef2011`; dev-ops commits at re-deploy)._
_(superseded historical note: TDD pairing 0.4.0 — re-updated mid-LV1; clean migration; phase neutral=`off`.)_
_0.4.0 notes: manifest `kitVersion=0.4.0`; new `.claude/hooks/lib.sh`; entry docs (CLAUDE/AGENTS) = thin managed block + my full team content kept as overlay; `tdd.config` kept (data-only); settings merged. **phase convention UNCHANGED — empty fails closed → use `off`** (no 0.3.0-class breakage this time). Rollback backup: `/tmp/based-pre-0.4/`._
**9 agents** (4 refreshed base: test-writer/implementer/tdd-critic + **new `planner`**; my 5 custom PO/architect/qa/PM/dev-ops untouched) · **4 hooks** (guard-edit-scope, run-suite, require-green-to-stop, + new **session-green-check** SessionStart baseline) · `.claude/tdd.config` migrated to 0.3.0 per-layer format (`TEST_CMD_<layer>`+globs+`resolve_layer`; `backend→pnpm test:backend` etc.) · method docs → `docs/tdd/` (incl. `project-invariants.md` filled with the Based invariants so the now-generic base agents stay Based-aware).
- **⚠️ DRIVING CHANGE — phase `off` is the new neutral; EMPTY phase now FAIL-CLOSES (blocks ALL edits).** Always set phase explicitly: `red`/`green`/`refactor` for cycles, **`off`** between cycles/at boundaries — **NEVER empty** (the old "phase: —" boundary convention is dead). Same for any parallel session.
- **⚠️ require-green-to-stop reverted to the simpler 0.3.0 version** — the navigator's stale-red re-verify hardening was overwritten. Re-apply if stale-cache false-blocks recur.
- **Restart pending:** new `settings.json` (SessionStart hook) + refreshed/new agents load at session start; THIS session continues on the OLD-loaded base agents (fine — same names; `planner` unused, the KICKOFF cycle order covers it). Hooks are LIVE now (gate works).
- **Pending chore (dev-ops/PM):** commit the **0.4.0** kit delta as `chore: update tdd-pairing kit to 0.4.0` — `git add CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md KICKOFF.md .claude/agents .claude/hooks .claude/settings.json .claude/.tdd-pairing docs/tdd .gitignore` — KEPT SEPARATE from `feat(lv1)`; leave `.claude/state/*` (the team's LV1) to their commit. (0.4.0 supersedes the earlier 0.3.0 chore.)
- **⚠️ old-loaded implementer writes source via Bash `cat >` heredoc** (bypassing the guard-edit-scope PreToolUse referee, then triggers run-suite via a state-file Edit). Harmless so far (every edit was in-scope: green phase, correct layer/`src`) and the orchestrator re-verifies each cycle (typecheck + suite + reads the file), but it IS a referee bypass — after restart, confirm the refreshed 0.3.0 implementer uses Write/Edit (or constrain its tools).

## Infrastructure / staging (deployed — outside the TDD loop)
AWS **staging is live** (architecture in ADR `docs/decisions/0005-staging-deployment.md`):
- **Frontend** https://d253xma588uo3l.cloudfront.net — S3 (private) + CloudFront/OAC. HTTP 200.
- **Backend**  https://pmf6qpvkfx.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com — App Runner (container from ECR).
  `/health` → 200 `{"status":"ok"}`; service RUNNING.
- IaC in `infra/` (CloudFormation `ecr.yaml` + `staging.yaml`); idempotent `infra/deploy-staging.sh`
  + `infra/destroy-staging.sh`. Region us-east-2, account 429844072978 (root keys — see ADR caution).
- **Build fix (kept the bar green):** the `frontend` `build` was `tsc -b`, which emits `.js` into
  `src/` → those emitted files broke `eslint` (no-undef on browser globals). Changed to
  `tsc --noEmit && vite build` (never pollutes `src`); `*.tsbuildinfo` gitignored. `pnpm verify`=0.
- **Harness gap noted:** the `run-suite` hook runs only the layer **tests**, not `lint`/`typecheck`,
  so a lint/type regression is invisible until `pnpm verify`. Keep `pnpm verify` in feature acceptance.
- **GEMINI_API_KEY + CORS wired (M3-ready):** backend has `@fastify/cors` (allowlist from
  `CORS_ORIGINS`, covered by `backend/tests/cors.test.ts`); App Runner gets `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a
  secret from an SSM SecureString (`/based/staging/gemini-api-key`) via `AppRunnerInstanceRole`,
  plus `GEMINI_MODEL` + `CORS_ORIGINS` (=CloudFront URL) env. Key lives only in `backend/.env`
  (gitignored) + SSM. Remaining for M3: implement `POST /narrate` + confirm the exact Gemini model id.

## Carry-forward risks (test at the named milestone)
- **M4:** `HostDirective.staging.fireAtMs` (ms) vs `Vantage.offsetSec` (sec) — convert
  explicitly (off-by-1000 trap); add a test.
- **M4:** `RankedFeed.events` "sorted desc by `eventScore`" — the ranker needs an ordering
  test (M1 uses a placeholder `eventScore = heatDelta`).
- **M3 (now):** cost-gating + secrets-from-env are the newly-required invariants — prove with tests
  (FE call-count: zero on idle / one per event / never on a timer; backend: key from env only, never
  in body or logs). Spoiler-safety now also means tier-aware hedging of the generated line.
- **M2 ✓ (done):** spoiler-safety + silence-budget proven by host-loop tests.

## Notes
- Cross-layer order: frontend-first; backend appears at M3 (Gemini `/narrate`).
- Narration: Gemini 3.1 Flash Live behind `POST /narrate`; key in `backend/.env`
  (`GEMINI_API_KEY`), documented empty in `.env.example`. (M3.)
- **§13 decisions (→ navigator)** — two OPEN; neither blocks starting M3:
  - **Tier-aware hedging** — ACTIVE for M3. PO rec: tier 1 plain; tiers 2–4 hedge ("looks like…");
    tier 4 explicitly unconfirmed (§10/§14). Model is stubbed in tests, so it doesn't block M3 BUILD;
    needed before showing a generated line externally.
  - **Spoiler-safety across surfaces (NEW)** — does no-spoiler bind the whole UI or only the host's
    voice? Surfaced by qa (rail leaks outcomes). PO rec: hedge the rail too (pro-creator/anti-spoiler
    moat). Re-opens M1's rail design; resolve together with tier-hedging; needed before an external
    demo with a visible rail.
  - Settled-for-now: persona (one host), voice (Web Speech), rights/embeds (placeholders → real ids
    at demo time). Re-attach before an external demo.
